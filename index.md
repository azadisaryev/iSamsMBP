**iSams MarkBook Paster** is an extension that enables copying/pasting grades into a mark book in iSams. When my school switched to iSams, and we had to start using Mark Books to enter grades for student reports, I realised with horror that there was no built-in functionality to paste grades from another source! I refused to spend my time clicking on individual mark book cells and selecting the grade (you can't even use the keyboard to interact with the mark book! only a mouse!), so I wrote this Chrome extension instead. Now you too can easily paste grades into iSams Mark Book!
