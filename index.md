**iSams MarkBook Paster** (iSamsMBP) is a Google Chrome extension that enables pasting grades into an iSams Mark Book from Google Steets, Excel or similar source. 

When I had to start using Mark Books in iSams to enter grades for student reports, I discovered that there was no built-in functionality to paste grades from another source! With number of individual grades I had to input exceeding several thousand, I did not feel like spending endless hours clicking on individual mark book cells and selecting the grade, so I wrote this Google Chrome extension instead. Now you too can easily paste grades into iSams Mark Book!

### Features

- Works only on iSams' Mark Book pages (Mark Book must be in 'edit' mode)
- Loads automatically (can be disabled in Options - see below)
- Simple guided user interface
- Grades can be pasted one column at a time (for now)
- Basic data validation built-in:
  * Checks that numder of grades being pasted matched the number of students in the mark book
  * Checks that values being pasted match the grade values accepted in the column being pasted into

### Options

- Enable/disable automatic loading of iSams MarkBook Paster on mark book pages in iSams

To access iSamsMBP's Options, right-click on the extension's icon in the Chrome toolbar and select 'Options'.
When automatic loading is disabled, you can still manually start iSamsMBP on a mark book page by right-clicking on the mark book and selecting `iSams MarkBook Paster` item.
