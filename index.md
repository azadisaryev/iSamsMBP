**GradesPaster for iSams Mark Book** is a Google Chrome extension that enables pasting grades into an iSams Mark Book from Google Steets, Excel or similar source. 

I created GradesPaster extension after I had to start using Mark Books in iSams and discovered there was no built-in copy-paste functionality. The idea of having to click thousands of times to enter all the grades for reports did not sit well with me, so I made this extension. Hope it makes your life as a teacher a little easier, too!

The extension loads automatically (can be turned off on the Options page - see below) on iSams Mark Book pages when in 'editing' mode. Currently it only lets you paste one column of grades at a time. On the very first paste, Google Chrome will prompt you to 'allow isams.cloud website to access your clipboard' - make sure to click "Allow", or you won't be able to paste grades!

### Features

- Loads on iSams' Mark Book pages (Mark Book must be in 'edit' mode) - does not interfere with any other websites
- Enabled automatically (can be disabled in Options - see _Options_ below)
- Simple, guided user interface
- Grades can be pasted one column at a time (for now)
- Data validation built-in:
  * Checks that number of grades being pasted matches number of students in the mark book
  * Checks that values being pasted match the grade values accepted in the column being pasted into

### Options

- Enable/disable automatic loading of GradesPaster on mark book pages in iSams

To access GradesPaster options, right-click on the extension's icon in the Chrome toolbar and select _'Options'_.

When automatic loading is disabled, you can still manually start GradesPaster on a mark book page by right-clicking on the mark book and selecting _GradesPaster for iSams Mark Book_ item.
